# learning-x86assembly
This repository was made as an archive for my Assembly language bootloader projects

I will be using Bochs 2.6.11 to boot small bootloader applications
I have been learning through an online book called "Writing a Simple Operating System â€” from Scratch" by "Nick Blundell" (https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)
